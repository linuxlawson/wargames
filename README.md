# Wargames WOPR

Wargames WOPR Computer Simulation

WOPR is a War Operation Plan Response super computer.  
Anyone familiar with the 1984 WarGames movie knows this.  


This is an interactive program which allows you
to communicate with WOPR (aka joshua). 

**To use:**    
Open Terminal.  
Navigate to correct directory  
Run program using:  
`python3 joshua.py`    
OR  
`./joshua.py`  


Below is a list of questions you can ask WOPR (joshua).     
Ask the listed questions in order and Joshua will respond.

**Questions for Joshua** (Begin after greeting):  


Hello, Joshua?

What classified address?

Are you still playing the game?

What is the primary goal?

Is this a game or is it real?

People sometimes make mistaks

What is the primary goal?

**Note:** I only added so many questions because its hard to remember the whole movie.  
Plus, it would drag on to much. Maybe I'll add more questions/answers someday.
