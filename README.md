## Wargames WOPR

Wargames WOPR Computer Simulation

WOPR is a War Operation Plan Response super computer.  
Anyone familiar with the 1984 WarGames Movie knows this.  


This is an interactive program which allows you
to communicate with WOPR (aka Joshua). 

**To use:**    
1. Open Terminal.  
2. Navigate to correct directory  
3. Run program using:  
`python3 joshua.py`    
or  
`./joshua.py`

<br>

After Greeting, ask the questions below in order   
and the WOPR computer (aka Joshua) will respond.  
 
<br>

Hello, Joshua?

What classified address?

Are you still playing the game?

What is the primary goal?

Is this a game or is it real?

People sometimes make mistaks

What is the primary goal?

**Note:** I only added so many questions because it would drag on to much.  
Maybe I'll add more questions/answers someday.
