# Wargames WOPR

Wargames WOPR Computer Simulation

The WOPR is a War Operation Plan Response super computer.  
Anyone familiar with the Movie knows this.  


This is an interactive program which allows you
to communicate with WOPR (aka joshua). 

I've been working on this lately and having fun with it.  
It ain't great but its better than it was.  

Below is a list of questions you can ask WOPR (joshua).  
They are up there in a text file too.   
Ask them somewhat correctly (and in order) and Joshua will respond.  


**Note:** I only added so many questions because its hard to remember the whole movie.  
Plus, it would drag on to much. Maybe I'll add more questions/answers someday.

**Questions for Joshua:** (Begin after greeting).  


Hello, Joshua?

What classified address?

Are you still playing the game?

What is the primary goal?

Is this a game or is it real?

People sometimes make mistaks

What is the primary goal?

**Note:**   
One problem I ran into was importing   
a module (target) into the main program (joshua).  

The problem was the import only ran once from the menu,  
and no more after that. This could not be.  

To fix this, I used reload, which caused it to run twice  
from the menu the first time around. This could not be, either.  

To fix that, I had to seperate the 2 instances.  
This is why it runs once at the beginning.     
This was not planned and eventually I will fix it.  

Anyway, thats just how it is for now.   
I'll keep messing around with it and see what happens.
