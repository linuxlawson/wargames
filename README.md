## Wargames WOPR

Wargames WOPR Computer Simulation

WOPR is a War Operation Plan Response super computer.  
Anyone familiar with the 1984 WarGames Movie knows this.  

**In the movie:**  
While attempting to hack into a computer game company.  
David Lightman unknowingly hacks into a system which doesn't identify itself.  
Assuming its the game company, he starts a game of Global Thermonuclear War.  
It soon becomes obvious he has actually hacked into a military super-computer.    
It also becomes obvious the WOPR has no intentions to stop playing  
until the game has been won.  

This is an interactive program which allows you
to communicate with WOPR (aka Joshua). 

**To use:**    
1. Open Terminal.  
2. Navigate to correct directory  
3. Run program using:  
`python3 joshua.py`    
or  
`./joshua.py`

password = joshua or Joshua  

<br>

After Greeting, ask the questions below in order   
and the WOPR computer (aka Joshua) will respond.  
 
<br>

Hello, Joshua?

What classified address?

Are you still playing the game?

What is the primary goal?

Is this a game or is it real?

People sometimes make mistaks

What is the primary goal?

**Note:** I only added so many questions because it would drag on to much.  
Maybe I'll add more questions/answers someday.
