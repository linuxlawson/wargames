## Wargames WOPR

Wargames WOPR Computer Simulation

WOPR is a War Operation Plan Response super computer.  
Anyone familiar with the 1983 WarGames Movie knows this.  

**In the movie:**  
While attempting to hack into a computer game company.  
David Lightman unknowingly hacks into a system which doesn't identify itself.  
Assuming its the game company, he starts a game of Global Thermonuclear War.  
It soon becomes obvious he has actually hacked into a military super-computer.    
It also becomes obvious the WOPR has no intentions to stop playing  
until the game has been won.
